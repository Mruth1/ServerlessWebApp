# ServerlessWebApp
Goal: Create a dynamic, serverless web application using AWS services to gain hands-on experience within a cloud computing environment. The goal for this is to learn more about building a static website hosted on S3, setting up an API gateway, creating Lambda functions, and integrating a database, more than likely DynamoDB.


All project-orientated files will be in the master branch.
