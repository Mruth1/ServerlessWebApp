This file will just be a log that I add to add some changes that may not be seen on this repo, this will most likely be on the S3 side of things since I am unfamiliar with integration within GitHub and S3.

2025-1-16.) Started hosting S3 static webpage for the following link (index.html in the master branch as of this moment): https://myserverless-webapp.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

2025-1-18.) I went ahead and started to update the front page of the web page, added some more projected-oriented focus elements and I should start my CSS designs shortly once I familiarize myself with CSS and how it works. 

2025-1-21.) After taking some time to learn CSS, I've made a base layout for the website. However, it's not the neatest / nicest website that has been seen, and the goal for this project isn't to delve that far into web development.
and is to learn more about AWS services and backend development work.
