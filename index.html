    <h2>What I value?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the things I particularly value is loyalty. Loyalty builds trust between two parties, which I believe is important for both professional and interpersonal relationships.
      Punctuality is another core trait I value. Being on time and prompt shows respect for others' time and increases efficiency.

    <h2>My Goals...</h2>
    <p>
      My goals include maintaining a good GPA, securing an internship for more experience, and making meaningful connections.
      I also strive to master C, the language of my current course. After all these semesters of learning, I've developed a love for it.
      I’ve worked with Python, C, C++, and Java, and this project will expand my limits.
