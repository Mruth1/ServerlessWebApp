<h1>My "Experiment" name TBA too.</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Marcus Ruth, and I am currently a full-time University of Central Florida Student.
  I am currently majoring in Computer Science. I have a passion for programming, computers and just computer science in General.</p>

<h2>What I value?</h2>
<p> There are so many traits in life that people value, so I think it is an interesting thing to talk about. One of the
  things I particularly value
  is loyalty. With this being a strong foundation in my own life, I feel as if loyalty builds trust between two parties.
  In my opinion, building trust is
  important for both professional and interpersonal relationships as it develops a stronger bond and allows for better
  cooperation in many cases.
  <br><br>
  Punctuality is another core trait that I strongly value. Being on time and prompt with any given task is essential
  being successful. It also shows respect for other's time, shows reliability within my own character, and also improves my own efficiency.
  <br>
  Although, it is subjective, I have always held this trait to myself since my adolescence.
</p>
<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
<p><u>AWS - S3, IAMS / Policy Making, CLI v2<br>C - Programming - DMA, Linkedlists, Data Structures, Algorithms<br>Java - OOP Principals, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Hierarchical structures<br>
## Other languages TBA (wip with this project and whatever I may have forgotten)</u></p>
<h2> My Goals...</h2>
<P>
  There are so many goals I want to accomplish within my lifetime! As of this moment, my current goals is to maintain a good GPA within the University I attend,
  attain an internship for more experience, and make more connections with those around me.
  <br><br>
  I love socializing with others, making friends and connecting. This in essence, is why I would like to make more connections. My last goal I want to accomplish may
  be a bit redundant to seeking an internship; However, I would love to master C, which is my current course's work language of choice. After all these semesters
  of learning, I found quite a love for C when it came to comparison of working with other languages. Something about pointers, let me tell you...<br>
  I've learned and used languages like Python, C, C++, and Java. With this being said
  I don't plan to limit myself to just those languages as this project is going to expand those limits.
</P>

<p>Link here for a form or something of this sort using API gateway, Lambda then to a DB</p>

<h2>What is the Goal for Creating This Webpage?</h2>
<p>
  As previously mentioned, I want to create an exemplary piece of work showing my rigor to learn and adapt to new things. Believe it or not, this is my first time
  ever working with HTML and CSS on the front end, let alone any language to really construct a web page for that matter. All work I have done has been through that beuatiful
  terminal / command prompt we all know and love. Even though some aspects of these projects do consist of using the terminal, I am having a rather fun time learning all the
  niche things about each language along the way.
  <br><br>
  Learning is truly such a nice privilege to have.
